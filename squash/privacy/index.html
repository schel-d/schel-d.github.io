    <h1>Squash Scorekeeper Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Squash Scorekeeper does not collect any sensitive user data.</p>
    <p>
      The only persisted data when the app is closed is the current game's
      status (the score, player nicknames, rules, and serving state), which is
      stored <b>only</b> on the users device, using Android's
      <a

      feature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Google Play or the Android operating system may collect other user data.
      This is outside the control or scope of the Squash Scorekeeper app.
